## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on detecting **deepfake audio** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on **mel spectrograms** extracted from `.wav` files. With the rise of synthetic voices and AI-generated speech, this model helps identify fake audio recordings with high accuracy.

## 🧠 Objective

🎯 Build a deep learning model to:
- Differentiate between **real** and **fake** audio samples
- Use **mel spectrograms** for feature extraction
- Apply **CNN** to classify audio effectively
- Evaluate performance on separate train, validation, and test sets
